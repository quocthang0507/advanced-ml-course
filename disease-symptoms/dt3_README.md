## Description

The dataset contains disease names along with the symptoms faced by the respective patient. There are a total of 773 unique diseases and 377 symptoms, with ~246,000 rows. The dataset was artificially generated, preserving Symptom Severity and Disease Occurrence Possibility.

## Interpretation Info

Several distinct groups of symptoms might all be indicators of the same disease. There may even be one single symptom contributing to a disease in a row or sample. This is an indicator of a very high correlation between the symptom and that particular disease.
A larger number of rows for a particular disease corresponds to its higher probability of occurrence in the real world. Similarly, in a row, if the feature vector has the occurrence of a single symptom, it implies that this symptom has more correlation to classify the disease than any one symptom of a feature vector with multiple symptoms in another sample.
